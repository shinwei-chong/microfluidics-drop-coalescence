# Part 2: Machine Learning-Based Drop Classification

This section focuses on developing a machine learning classification model to predict drop states: 
* single drop 
* doublet 
* coalescing drop


Note: files currently stored here were initially created in mid-December but I have not looked into this section for awhile now. Will complete the comments and notes in script soon. - SWC
