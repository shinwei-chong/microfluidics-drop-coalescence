# Part 1: Video Processing

This section focuses on processing raw experimental videos to prepare data for machine learning classification model. 

## Main Scripts  
1. ***dropCropMULTI.m***  
   'Plug-and-play' script to process videos. Each video processed will generate two output folders - 
   one containing full extracted frames,
